# licences

A repository with a collection of useful licences.

## Usage

- You decide which licence to use
- You copy relevant txt file to your repo
- You rename it to LICENCE
- You change the year and the copyright holder name
- You add headers to source files
    ```
    // Copyright © 2023 Luka Ivanović
    // This code is licensed under MIT licence (see LICENCE for details)
    ```
- You add licence notice in project's README(.md) file
    - `This code is licensed under MIT licence (see LICENCE for details).`

## How to choose

For now, there are 4 licences included:
- MIT
- ISC
- BSD 2-clause (FreeBSD)
- BSD 3-clause (New BSD)

and they are _mostly_ the same, i.e. they offer:

- permissions:
    - commercial-use
    - modifications
    - distributions
    - private-use
- conditions:
    - include-copyright
- limitations:
    - liability
    - warranty

The biggest _difference_ is that BSD 3-clause limits the usage of copyright holder's name(s) in usage of advertisement for derivative works (tl;dr).

Now you have to choose your own adventure. 

Have fun :)
